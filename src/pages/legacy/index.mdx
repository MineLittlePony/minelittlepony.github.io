## Original thanks

Verdana made a page with words of thanks to contributors of mod which you can read [here](/legacy/thanks).

## Old versions of the mod

If you want to play earlier versions of this mod you can download them from Mega <a href={Links.cloudArchive}>cloud</a>. Please note that they are not supported at all.

The earlier versions were written by **Verdana** until version 1.7. For those versions, they were ported by **Rene_Z** and **thatapplefreak**. Any later versions were ported by **KillJoy**

> **Note:** The 1.7 versions are ported from [VoxelModPack](http://voxelmodpack.com/modpacks.html) ([MinecraftForum thread](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2178137-mine-little-pony-friendship-is-crafting-v1-7-10-1))

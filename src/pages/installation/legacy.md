## Table of contents

## Required files

- [LiteLoader installer](https://www.liteloader.com/download) - needed to play Minecraft with client mods. Example filename: `liteloader-installer-1.12.2-00-SNAPSHOT.exe`. File extension can be either `.jar` or `.exe`.
- [Mine Little Pony mod](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/MineLittlePony/releases/tag/1.12.2.3.2.11a) - the mod itself

## Installing LiteLoader

Once you've downloaded all the files you need to install LiteLoader. Run the downloaded installer file, select the settings you want and click the "OK" button.

## Installing the mod

After installing LiteLoader you need to add your mods to the game. Place downloaded `.jar` files into `mods` folder in your Minecraft folder:

- `%APPDATA%\.minecraft` on Windows
- `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` on macOS
- `~/.minecraft` on Linux

## Play the game!

If everything was done correctly, a new Minecraft profile called something like `LiteLoader 1.12.2` should appear. Select it and launch the game. Now you should turn into a pony!

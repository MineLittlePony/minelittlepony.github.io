# Installing using vanilla launcher

## Required files

- [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) - allows playing Minecraft with mods.
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) - mod required for most Fabric mods including Mine Little Pony.
- [HD Skins](https://modrinth.com/mod/hd-skins) (optional) - adds an in-game interface to manage your skins. Also allows to use HD skins and to upload them to our server.
- [Mine Little Pony](https://modrinth.com/mod/mine-little-pony) - the mod itself.

## Installing Fabric

Once you’ve downloaded all the files, you need to install Fabric. Run the downloaded installer file, select the settings you want and click the “Install” button.

## Installing the mods

After installing Fabric you need to add your mods to the game. Place downloaded `.jar` files into the `mods` folder in your Minecraft folder:

- `%APPDATA%\.minecraft` on Windows
- `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` on macOS
- `~/.minecraft` on Linux

## Play the game!

If everything was done correctly, a new Minecraft profile called something like `fabric-loader-1.20.4` should appear. Select it and launch the game. Now you should turn into a pony!

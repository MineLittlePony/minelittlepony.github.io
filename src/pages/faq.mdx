### Where can I ask questions not listed here?

You can always ask them on our <a href={Links.discordInvite}>Discord server</a>.

### Why does it take my skin so long to update?

Sometimes it takes the skin server a little longer to update. Please be patient and wait until your skin updates.

### Does FillyCam still work?

FillyCam has been discontinued. Use [BigPony](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/BigPony/releases) instead.

### Is there a Forge version?

No, but with pre 1.13 versions, LiteLoader [can be installed as a Forge mod](http://www.liteloader.com/explore/docs/user:install:forge). You can find the instructions [here](/installation/legacy/).

### How do I retrieve my skin from the server?

If you are using an official Minecraft account you can do it [here](/tools/).

### Where do I report bugs?

You can do it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/MineLittlePony/issues) or in the `#bugs` channel of our <a href={Links.discordInvite}>Discord server</a>.

### Does this mod provide any extra abilities?

No, the mod only transforms the player model into pony. You can checkout [Unicopia](https://github.com/Sollace/Unicopia/releases) or find other mods that provide extra abilities.

### When is the next version going to be released?

New versions should be in progress or already available as soon as the devs have free time.

### Does this mod work on the console or mobile versions?

Unfortunately not, we do not currently have the ability to port the mod to those versions.

### Why can't I upload skins on cracked versions?

Uploading skins is only available on legitimate paid versions of the game. We do not support pirated or cracked copies, this is out of our control.

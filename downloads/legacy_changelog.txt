0.1 - Initial release.
0.2 - Bug fix release, now compatible with Zombe's Fly Mod and maybe more other mods too.
0.3 - Bug fix release to fix some model and animation errors. The player arm no longer stutters in first-person. Hair has been repositioned so it is no longer too far back on the head. Legs no longer sway by themselves if the player is standing still. The tail sways a bit now instead, does not appear detached from the body, and looks much better. This update also fixes the issue that caused horn and wing models to not show up correctly on a player if the player has not added a compatible skin on minecraft.net.
0.4 - Feature release to add new animations to pegasus ponies when flying and add new and improved background ponies. Also updates ears so the ear texture comes from a previously unused area of the skin rather than the main body area, allowing the ears to be a different colour to the body.
0.5 - Major rewrite to migrate to Player Model API and dramatically improve compatibility. Added a version that ModLoader can load. Added configurable ponyfication settings. Added new animations for unicorns. Fixed some bugs with flying animations playing incorrectly.
0.6 - Another big rewrite to remove an unnescessary class. Improved compatibility since 0.5 and fixed regression relating to Zombe's mod pack. Fixed some memory leaks. Fixed a regression introduced in 0.4 where the tail would not sway when standing still. Fixed a regression introduced in 0.5 where the position of the held item was incorrect.
0.7 - Located and fixed the memory leak that plagued 0.5 and 0.6 related to first person camera. Fixed position of held item. Fixed bug that caused unicorns to glitch when other players swung an item.

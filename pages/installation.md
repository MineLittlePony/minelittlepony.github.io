## Download Mine Little Pony and Fabric {#step1}
Mine Little Pony requires the mod loader Fabric in order to run. Download the Mine Little Pony mod and the Fabric installer from the front page. If you'd like to have the option to use HD skins or the mod's own skin server make sure you also download and install the HDSkins mod, which is linked with the latest version of the mod.

## Installing Mine Little Pony and HDSkins{#step3}
The Mine Little Pony mod should have a `.jar` extension. Place the `.jar` file in the `mods` folder that has been created in your `minecraft` root folder. Be sure to also download and move the [Fabric API .jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api){:target="_blank"} and HDSkins jar into the mods folder as well.

## Select the Fabric-Loader profile and play! {#step4}
If everything was done correctly, a new Minecraft profile named  "Fabric-Loader" with the installed version in the name should appear in the drop down menu. Choose that profile and launch the game and you're done! Congratulations on your newfound poniness!

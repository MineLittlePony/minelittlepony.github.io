## Select the Fabric-Loader profile and play! {#step4}
If everything was done correctly, a new Minecraft profile named  "Fabric-Loader" with the installed version in the name should appear in the drop down menu. Choose that profile and launch the game and you're done! Congratulations on your newfound poniness!

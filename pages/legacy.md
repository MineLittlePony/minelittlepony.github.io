## Old versions of the mod
If you want to play earlier versions of this mod you can [download them from Mega cloud](https://mega.nz/#F!NYJQGILa!X70azQPM_psKwpBPW2EleQ){:target="_blank"}. Please note that they are not supported at all.

The earlier versions were written by **Verdana** until version 1.7. For those versions, they were ported by **Rene_Z** and **thatapplefreak**. Any later versions were ported by **KillJoy**

> **Note:** The 1.7 versions are ported from [VoxelModPack](http://voxelmodpack.com/modpacks.html){:target="_blank"} ([MinecraftForum thread](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2178137-mine-little-pony-friendship-is-crafting-v1-7-10-1){:target="_blank"})
